## Info
---
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS TYPE +suggest (suggestion) in any chat that has snappingbot - this will write  your username and suggestion onto a file which i will check regularly :) 

Apod changes at Midnight Eastern time (US East Coast). 

++ commands means that only the bot owner (turtoise) can use

## If you make the bot say anything against twitch TOS you will be put on the banlist and you will not be able to use this bot again.

QuinnDT - helping a fuck ton with everything.

Matthewde - Helping a ton with the theory of different commands and ideas.
